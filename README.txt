Hello,

Welcome on my new easy website template.
You could create a web page just changing the xml files and also the CSS.

* Xml files are on the folder 'data/xml'
	In this folder, you have:
		- The lang folders (fr, en, jp, ...):
			Each lang folder contains:
				+ The 'menu.xml' file: 
					This file contains the menu of your website. It links the name of your page to the xml page name.
					
				+ The 'articles' folder:
					This folder contains all your articles for this langage. The name of the xml file should be the same for all the langages.
					If you create a new article, you have to duplicate it on each langage folders, even if it is empty.
					The configuration.xml file is a special one. It allows the user to change the langage of the site.
					
		- The pages folder:
			This folder contains the pages of your website. They should be referenced in the 'menu' file of each lang.
			Each page file contains the list of the articles in each page. This article name should be the same for all the langages.
			
		- The header.xml: 
			This file is used to provide iniformations about the website.
			You could change the css file here, on the 'styleSheet' part. Do not put the .css extension, as it is added automatically.
		
* Css files are on the folder 'css'
	To modify the css file, you need to know how to do it. Search on google.
