Hello,

Welcome on my new easy website template.
You could create a web page just changing the xml files and also the CSS.

* Xml files are on the folder 'data/xml'
	In this folder, you have:
		- The lang folders (fr, en, jp, ...):
		
		- The pages folder:
			
		- The header.xml: 
			This file is used to provide iniformations about the website.
			You could change the css file here, on the 'styleSheet' part. Do not put the .css extension, as it is added automatically.
		
* Css files are on the folder 'css'
	To modify the css file, you need to know how to do it. Search on google.
